This needs to be fixed by syncing status reliably with Supabase backend as well as local storage.Coach Screen Issues:AI response area is too small relative to the large text input box, making it hard to read previous chat responses clearly.The layout for chatbot interface, including user questions and AI answers, needs better balancing so responses are more readable and prominent.The input box should be resized appropriately and the overall chat UI made clear and visually appealing.Required Improvements:Fix all text and UI element overflow so they never go outside their boxes or screen boundaries, ensuring responsive mobile-first designs.Standardize box sizes and spacing across all components (Welcome, Quick Stats, Height/Progress, Daily Routine, Achievements, Tasks, Quick Actions).Correct numeric display issues, removing extra zeros to show accurate measurements and statistics.Implement a responsive, dynamic graph that displays current state, goals, and AI predictions clearly with different colors and legends in one chart.Fully implement functional Achievements section with real data tracking.Remove emojis from dashboard for a cleaner look.Make AI growth predictions more realistic and visually intuitive, limiting projections to 1 year max.Revamp gradients with modern smooth color blending for a sophisticated look.Replace jittery animations with smooth, subtle, and polished transitions that improve user experience without distraction.Fix Tasks tab overflow issues, retain completion status reliably through Supabase and local app storage.On Coach screen, resize chat input box and enlarge AI response area for better readability and user interaction.Ensure overall app UI looks premium with polished shadows, consistent spacing, aligned components, and harmonious color scheme.Optimize for the best mobile user experience with fixed screen layouts and no overflow or cutoffs.
